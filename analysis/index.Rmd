Project website for benchmarking methods for single-cell DE methods. 

* Differential expression methods initial evaluations using PBMC dataset
    * Initial evals focusing on sample sizes per group (50, 250)
    * Results on relationships between sample size, power and effect size; [RESULTS](eval_initial.html)
    * Power and false discovery rate: betasd=1, 1K genes drawn randomly, 10% true effects [RESULTS](eval_initial_power.html)
    * Type I error: betasd=1, 1K genes drawn randomly [RESULTS](eval_initial_type1.html)




* Data curation procedure described [here](../dsc/data/README.md).
    * 10x Genomics PBMC dataset.

## One-time investigations

* Replicate results in Van den Berge et al., 2018
    * Curate PBMC dataset using [their code](pbmc_berge_null.html)
    * Simulate scRNA-seq data with signals using [their code](sim_power_berge_pbmc.html)
