Project website for benchmarking methods for single-cell DE methods.

* Investigate Type I error control in simulated null datasets
    * Using [single-cell real dataset (10X PBMC data)](test.html), and consider two scenarios:
      * Case 1: Replicate results in Berge et al., 2018.  
      * Case 2: Assess type I error as a function of sample size. (45 and 300) 
      * Note that data used in Case 1 was curated as described in Van den Berge et al., 2018, see [here](pbmc_berge_null.html) for steps. 

* Power evaluation 
    * Using [Van den Berge et al. 2018 simulated data](sim_power_berge_pbmc_results.html), generated here using their [code](sim_power_berge_pbmc.html)
    

* Data curation procedure is described [here](../dsc/data/README.md).
    * 10x Genomics PBMC dataset.
