approximate poisson distribution with a mixture of normal distribution

- consider log-likelihood under varying values of lambda
- might lose efficiency by using normal instead of poisson

- make a null distribution

big picture idea:
- for each gene, estimate its poisson distribution with normal distribution
- make taylor expansion around values that are interested in

ash on poisson count with unimodal prior; then do taylor series expansion around mean

- assume genes are independent


- change read me, why data not integer value

simulation + method
